          <p><b>Michael</b> is a 3rd Year BS Computer Engineering Student of University
            of the East Manila (UE Manila). He's a free spirited individual that thrives to
            enjoy the present, but not at the expense of his future. Still not aware of
            his primary goal in life, he still eagerly jumps into opportunities to
            experience new things in life.</p>

          <p><b>"In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years." -Abraham Lincoln</b></p>

          <p>Like any other students, his duties as a student is well above his
            priorities, but still below his thirst for finding new entertaining things
            to do. As he is aware of his laziness to do a lot of things, he delevoped
            a skill to find motivation in every little things he do in life. He now
            believes that there is more to gain in enjoying life one step at a time,
            rather than mulling over the difficulties ahead or the uncertainties the
            future hold.</p>
